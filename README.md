### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aline Bastos, and I am from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. 

I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2001 unofficially, and since 2010 officially. 

I have worked with a lot of different projects and companies, and I love to contribute to the community and mentoring people.

Now I have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DeFrontcomAline) to show how to initiate in the Front-End development world, how to contribute with open source and communities, and I am starting there a Front-End course focused on Accessibility, Usability, Performance, Best Practices, and SEO.
